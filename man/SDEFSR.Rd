\title{SDEFSR: A package for Subgroup Discovery with Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems in R}
\description{
The SDEFSR package provide a tool for read KEEL datasets and four evolutionary fuzzy rule-based 
algorithms for subgroup discovery.
}
\details{
The algorithms provided works with datasets in KEEL, ARFF or CSV format and also with \code{data.frame} objects.
   
   The package also provide a Shiny app for making the same tasks that the package can do
   and can display some additional information about data for making an exploratory analysis.
   
   The algorithms provided are Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems (EFS) which take advantages of evolutionary algorithms 
   for maximize more than one quality measure and fuzzy logic, which makes a representation of numerical variables that are
   more understandable for humans and more robust to noise. 
   
   The algorithms in the SDEFSR package support target variable with more than two values. However, this target variables
   must be categorical. Thus, if you have a numeric target variable, a discretization must be perfomed before executing the
   method.
