\title{Launch a web interface for use the algorithms easily.}
\usage{
SDEFSR_GUI()
}
\description{
Launches a Shiny-based interface for the package in your browser.
}
\details{
The package \code{SDEFSR} provide simple, shiny-based web interface for performs the taks 
    easily. The interface only work with new datasets loaded directly in the platform.
  
    The web application is structured as follows:
\itemize{
    \item{ The first you have to do is load your training and test files. This files must be valids KEEL format files.}
    \item{ After chose your datasets, you can view information about the dataset or execute the algorithm}
    \item{ You can choose the target variable or the variable to visualize and choose the target value or execute the algorithm for all the values.}
    \item{ Choosed the target variable, you can  choose the algorithm to execute and change his parameters with the controls provided.}
    \item{ After you can execute the algorithm. The results are exposed in three tabs that are at the top of the page, just at the right of the "Exploratory Analysis" tab.}
}
    The tables can be sorted for each value and also you can search and filter values.
